# Über currency extractor
Small code to be used like in zapier.com to format amount extracted from Über receipt: turn currency sign into 3-letters currency, split out even if there's no space between the sign and the number.

Included
- unit tests (can have a beat of BDD cleanup/restyled)
- couple of binaries to set up a new environment (creating virtual_env, running pip, etc)
- minimalist requirements
